# Auto Coin Sorter for Many Currencies

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:499177

An **automatic** coin sorter for **many currencies**.
See also [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:499177)
for the printed object(s) and printing instructions,
and [YouTube](http://youtu.be/7F2fIF9PNBk) for a short demo video.

To **store a coin**, you may release a coin from the rightmost top,
and it will slide down the hill and go into the right tube.
To **get a coin**, you may pull the whole rack out and take out any coin.


## Canadian Split Fork

The original is too large to print on a Monoprice Select Mini so I have split it into two parts. 

* Part one is for $1 and $2 coins
* Part two is for 25¢ 10¢ and 5¢ coins (1¢ coins no longer in circulation)

Have added a base to hold part on and part 2 aligned. 
Have added a removable guard to ensure smaller coins don't bounce out front during sorting.
