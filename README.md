An **automatic** coin sorter for **many currencies**.
See also [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:499177)
for the printed object(s) and printing instructions,
and [YouTube](http://youtu.be/7F2fIF9PNBk) for a short demo video.

To **store a coin**, you may release a coin from the rightmost top,
and it will slide down the hill and go into the right tube.
To **get a coin**, you may pull the whole rack out and take out any coin.

**Versions we have currently:**

* US dollar (USD)
* Euro (EUR)
* Swiss franc (CHF)
* Canadian dollar (CAD)
* Thai Baht (THB)
* Chinses Yuan (CNY)


## Canadian Split Branch

The original is too large to print on a Monoprice Select Mini so I have split it into two parts. 

* Part one is for $1 and $2 coins
* Part two is for 25¢ 10¢ and 5¢ coins (1¢ coins no longer in circulation)

Considering a bracket to hold sections aligned.
